# PassVault

A Second Year Mini Project.
### Tech Stack:
Frontend : <code>HTML</code>, <code>CSS</code>, <code>JS</code>  
Backend  : <code>PHP</code>, <code>AJAX</code>  
Database : <code>SQL</code>  

## Problem Statement:
In the modern world, we have accounts on multiple platforms which require password
authentication. It is difficult to create and remember so many passwords. It is always
advised that the passwords should be mutually exclusive and unique so the possibility
of getting hacked and having our data breached is lesser, considering that some of the
information we put out is sensitive and confidential.
